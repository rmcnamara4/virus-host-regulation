# 6-OptimalityReporters

In this folder I include files that contain the sequences we curated for the
verification of *Aedes albopictus* optimality.

## Data

+ **./egfp_icodon_reporters.csv**: EGFP sequences that contain different synonymous mutations
in order to alter the optimality of the sequence

+ **./nt_out_of_frame_reporters.csv**: reporter sequence that is optimal in mosquito when
read in the first frame, and non-optimal in mosquito when read in the second frame
