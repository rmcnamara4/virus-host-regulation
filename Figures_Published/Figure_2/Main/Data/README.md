In this folder I have the data files that are used to plot the subfigures for
Figure 2 - Main. In the *Scripts/* folder I include the scripts that are used to
collect and create these data files.

## Scripts

+ **./Scripts/collect_optimalities.sh**: Bash script to collect all of the known codon
stability coefficients for various species; also collects the CSC values for *Aedes albopictus*
C6/36 cells using 3 different transcription-blocking drugs

## Data

+ **./codon_optimalities.csv**: contains the CSC values for various species

+ **./mosquito_csc.csv**: contains the CSC values calculated for *Aedes albopictus* C6/36
cells using 3 different transcription-blocking drugs
