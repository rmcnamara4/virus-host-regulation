# Figure 1 - Main - Plots

In this folder I have the code and the plots for each of the subfigures for
Figure 1 - Main.

For each subdirectory:

+ **./{subdirectory}/{file_name}.R**: R script to plot the subfigure

+ **./{subdirectory}/{file_name}.pdf**: PDF of the subfigure produced by running the
R script

+ **./{subdirectory}/{file_name}.ai**: Illustrator file of the plot for easy manipulation;
some cleaning of the PDF plot might have been done in the Illustrator file

Note: some of the subdirectories might only contain an Illustrator file of a schematic;
no R script is necessary to produce this file
